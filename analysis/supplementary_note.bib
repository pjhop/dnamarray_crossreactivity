	abstract = {We report a new class of artifacts in DNA methylation measurements from Illumina HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC arrays. These artifacts reﬂect failed hybridization to target DNA, often due to germline or somatic deletions and manifest as incorrectly reported intermediate methylation. The artifacts often survive existing preprocessing pipelines, masquerade as epigenetic alterations and can confound discoveries in epigenome-wide association studies and studies of methylation-quantitative trait loci. We implement a solution, P-value with out-ofband (OOB) array hybridization (pOOBAH), in the R package SeSAMe. Our method effectively masks deleted and hyperpolymorphic regions, reducing or eliminating spurious reports of epigenetic silencing at oft-deleted tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A and RB1 in cases with somatic deletions. Furthermore, our method substantially decreases technical variation whilst retaining biological variation, both within and across HM450 and EPIC platform measurements. SeSAMe provides a light-weight, modular DNA methylation data analysis suite, with a performant implementation suitable for efﬁcient analysis of thousands of samples.},

	abstract = {The rapid increase of omic data has greatly facilitated the investigation of associations between omic profiles such as DNA methylation (DNAm) and complex traits in large cohorts. Here, we propose a mixed-linear-model-based method called MOMENT that tests for association between a DNAm probe and trait with all other distal probes fitted in multiple random-effect components to account for unobserved confounders. We demonstrate by simulations that MOMENT shows a lower false positive rate and more robustness than existing methods. MOMENT has been implemented in a versatile software package called OSCA together with a number of other implementations for omic-data-based analyses.},
